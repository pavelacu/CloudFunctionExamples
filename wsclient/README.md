 3. Clone or download this repo directory.
 4. You must have the Firebase CLI installed. If you don't have it install it with `npm install -g firebase-tools` and then configure it with `firebase login`.
 5. Configure the CLI locally by using `firebase use --add` and select your project in the list.
 6. Install dependencies locally by running: `cd functions; npm install; cd -`


## Deploy and test

This sample comes with a web-based UI for testing the function.
To test locally do:

 1. Start serving your project locally using `firebase serve --only hosting,functions`
 2. Open the app in a browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
 3. .


To deploy and test on prod do:

 1. Deploy your project using `firebase deploy`
 2. Open the app using `firebase open hosting:site`, this will open a browser.
